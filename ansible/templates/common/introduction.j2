This is an example walkthrough for installing OMERO.web in a **virtual environment** using a dedicated system user. Installing OMERO.web in a virtual environment is the preferred way. For convenience in this walkthrough, we will use the **{{ omero_user }} system user** and define the main OMERO.web configuration options as environment variables. Since 5.6, a new ``OMERODIR`` variable is used, you should first unset ``OMERO_HOME`` (if set) before beginning the installation process.
